We all know monolithic applications - based on a big framework like Ruby on Rails, Django, or PHP Symfony, made up from one huge code base hacked by a huge team of developers.

  

These monoliths are being broken up and replaced by microservices - single unit of functionality exposed through some API. Microservices are growing in popularity.

**Comfortable**

Well, don’t get too comfortable - it’s time to shake things up again, as we now have serverless.

 1. Serverless
 2. Developed

Serverless is an architecture that involves creating single units of functionality that are invoked in isolation of each other. Each unit is developed and billed in isolation.
